# JS.RPS
A Rock Paper Scissors Javascript game for kids that I made out of my passion for game developement. 

### Game Description 

Playing the game is straight forward, and it will return a message if anything is wrong i.e: only one user chooses a hand and he tries to start the match.
To play, a user can play with a friend or alone, to play alone the user needs to choose a hand for player one, then click play vs bot and then ready up, the match will start.
To play with a friend the users need to both choose a hand, while making sure the other play does not have a peek of the screen, then ready up, the match will start.

##### The game will not ready up if: 
* both users are not ready
* one user is ready but bot has not been activated


### Built List
* Plain JavaScript
* Lots of jQuery
